# DATA STRUCTURES

## 1. Information Theory and Hardware

smaller piece of information - bit

phylosophy - bit is idea of truth

1800's I - true 0 -> false

1930's - mechanical, electrical switches
logic gates 
true - on
false - off

transistor - individual switch
equivalent to neuron

one laptop - 1.4 billion switches

tape drives - sequential access of data

late 80's - magnectic hard drives bacome popular

allows for jumping through the data, fast writting

solid state drive - SSD

hard memory - large size - slow access, blocking

ram - volatile - quick access - smaller space - stores date while powered

CPU - logical
L1 cache
L2 cache
L3 cache

fastest - CPU register

64 bits - more precision with math


## 2. Abstraction and Encoding
